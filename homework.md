## Homework Assignments
Your homework consists of two parts (each 10% of the total grade): WebAssign (WA) and written (WRH).
Below are written homework assignments  in reverse chronological order.  The [Schedule](assets/general/s26/schedule.pdf) also shows the due dates for WRH. WebAssign will be posted after each class on [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/30047) with the deadline next day.

Assignments are **due by 11:59pm on the day given**.  Please turn in each written assignment (WRH) by uploading **single .PDF file** to Gradescope (accessed through the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/30047).)

After each written assignment (WRH) is due, solutions will be posted at the **Modules tab** of the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/30047).

Before doing an assignment, please read the corresponding section of the textbook.
