Below are homework assignments  in reverse chronological order.  The [Schedule](assets/general/F25/schedule.pdf) also shows the due dates.

Assignments are **due by 11:59pm on the day given**.  Please turn in each written assignment (WRH) by uploading **single .PDF file** to Gradescope (accessed through the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/27085).)

After each written assignment (WRH) is due, solutions will be posted at the **Modules tab** of the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/27085).
